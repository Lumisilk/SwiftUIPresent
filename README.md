## Features

- Add the missing fade-in fade-out (crossDissolve) and popover presentation style to SwiftUI.
- Bringing the SwiftUI sheet's height adjustment (detents) API, exclusive to iOS 16, to iOS 15.
- Make your own presentation style and use it in SwiftUI.
- No private API or Objective-C

## Requirements

- iOS/iPadOS 14.0+
- Xcode 14.3+

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

Follow the [tutorial published by Apple](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/adding_package_dependencies_to_your_app) using the URL for the SwiftUIPresent repo with the current version.

`https://github.com/Lumisilk/SwiftUIPresent.git`

## Usage

Use `present(isPresented: Binding<Bool>, style: some PresentationStyle)` for simple bool presentation control,

Or `present<Item: Identifiable>(item: Binding<Item?>, style: some PresentationStyle)` for optional data binding.

```swift
import SwiftUIPresent

struct Example: View {
    @State private var isPresented = false

    var body: some View {
        Button("Present") {
            isPresented = true
        }
        .present(isPresented: $isPresented, style: .fade) {
            Text("Your present content")
        }
    }
}
```

### Built-in styles

| PresentationStyle                                            | The corresponding UIKit styles       |
| ------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `.sheet(detents: [UISheetPresentationController.Detent])`    | `.formSheet`                         |
| `.fade(backgroundColor: UIColor = .clear)`                   | `.overFullScreen` Ã— `.crossDissolve` |
| `.popover(backgroundColor: UIColor? = nil)`<br /> (`backgroundColor` indicates the bubble's background color, which you typically do not change) | `.popover`                           |

### Create your own style

Conforming to  `PresentationStyle`, provide you own UIViewController implementation.

(Will add more explanation later)

## Limitation

Here are some limitations and issues you may encounter when using SwiftUIPresent.
If you've found something new, or know how to fix them, please submit an issue or make a PR. 

### Animation

`withAnimation(_:_:)` has no effect on the presented content. Use `animation(_:value:)` modifier instead.

### Implicit value passing

Passing values implicitly via `Preference` and `Environment` is not supported. (`foregroundColor`, `navigationTitle`, etc.)

It is technically possible to pass all values through Environment. But that wouldn't be appropriate because not all values are suitable to be passed. For example, when there is content being presented modally, the text color of the button will set to gray by the system. If all `Environment` values are passed, the button on the presented content will also be gray, which is not appropriate. It is hard to determine what values should be passed and what should not, so you should explicitly set the values you want in the presented content.

### Present from the start

Setting `isPresented` to true with popover style from the start may not work correctly. Try delaying the assignment by using `onAppear` with `Task` or `DispatchQueue`.

## Roadmap

- [ ] Add documents
- [ ] Support dismiss from the presented content itself.
- [ ] Add optional  `onDismiss` argument to sheet and popover styles.
